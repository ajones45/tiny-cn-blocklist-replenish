This list is a very small set of block list, basically it is based on this research [Android OS Privacy Under the Loupe â€“ A Tale from the East](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01890.pdf) to include a few tracking domains.

It only blocks some of (not all) trackers from the apps or manufactors below. Based on research, 

- mi
- huawei
- oppo
- one plus
- etc
- some apps and websites
  - tencent apps
  - some not that common NSFW, Gambling websites


> Please do not use this list alone, since it does not block all trackers, ads, it only focus on a few phone manufacture and apps tracking domains.

Some places you can find a much bigger block lists.
